This web app: **fetches real-time brewery data from the Open Brewery DB API and displays it in a clean, responsive dashboard. Users can search for breweries by name, city, or state, and filter them by type. The app shows summary statistics like total breweries, brewery types, and top states.**

Time spent: **8-9** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - Total Breweries: Total number fetched from API

    - Brewery Types: Count per type

    - Top States: Top 5 states with the most breweries
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar 
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types
  - e.g., as a text input, a dropdown or radio selection, and/or a slider
- [x] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Multiple filters (search and type) work simultaneously
and Dropdown used for filtering (brewery_type)
